Who am I?
--------

🧠 Brain lover! Every day I spend my free time with a lot of information about the brain. 

🤓 Also, I am programmer which loves his work (maybe because of this, I don`t have long relationships 😃).

🤔 I`m not a typical programmer which knows only one sphere. I want to know maximum from all programmer things.


⚙️My main stack is:
--------
- Golang
- Javascript (Typescript)
- React / Vue
- PostgreSQL / MySQL
