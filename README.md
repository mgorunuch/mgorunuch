Who am I?
--------

🧠 Brain lover! Every day I spend my free time with a lot of information about the brain. 

🤓 Also, I am a programmer who loves his work (~~maybe because of this, I don`t have long relationships~~ 😃).

🤔 I`m not a typical programmer who is only experienced in one area. I want to know maximum of all the programming things.


⚙️My main stack is:
--------
- Golang
- Javascript (Typescript)
- React / Vue
- PostgreSQL / MySQL
